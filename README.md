# PayFlux

> **High-performance payment orchestration engine built in Rust for reliable, fault-tolerant payment execution across multiple payment providers.**

**Rust • Actix Web • Tokio • PostgreSQL • Redis • SQLx • Docker • REST**

---

## Project Overview

PayFlux is a production-oriented backend that explores the core engineering challenges of modern payment infrastructure. It focuses on building a resilient payment orchestration layer capable of routing transactions across multiple providers while ensuring correctness, consistency, and reliability.

---

## Business Problem

Modern payment systems must handle failures without compromising transaction integrity.

PayFlux addresses challenges such as:

* Duplicate payment requests
* Provider outages
* Network timeouts
* Retry handling
* Transaction consistency
* Monetary precision

---

## Core Domain

### Payment Lifecycle

```
CREATED
    │
    ▼
PROCESSING
   ╱       ╲
  ▼         ▼
SUCCESS   FAILED
```

Every payment follows a deterministic lifecycle, ensuring only valid state transitions while preserving transactional consistency.

---

## System Capabilities

* RESTful payment API
* Multi-provider payment routing
* Distributed idempotency with Redis
* Automatic retry strategy
* Provider failover
* Persistent transaction storage
* Structured logging
* Explicit payment state machine

---

                      Success           Failure
                          │                 │
                          ▼                 ▼
                 Persist SUCCESS   Persist FAILED
                          │
                          ▼
                   HTTP Response
```

Every request is validated, protected by Redis-backed idempotency, persisted before execution, and processed through a resilient orchestration pipeline. Transient failures trigger retries, while unrecoverable failures automatically fail over to a secondary payment provider before the final transaction state is recorded.
